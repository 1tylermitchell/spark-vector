 * This package contains a series of helpers to create and manage JDBC connections to `Vector(H)`, to define equivalence of `SparkSQL` and `Vector(H)` data types,
 * to create tables when they not exist (respecting input `DataFrame`'s schema), to obtain column metadata for `Vector(H)` tables, and high level methods to initiate
 * loading to `Vector(H)` tables.
